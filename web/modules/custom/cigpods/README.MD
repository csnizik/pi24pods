  - Add Awardee
  - Add Award
  - Add Field Assessment
  - Add Results
  - Add Soil Test Result
  - Add Method
  - Add Operation

#### ~~./cigpods.module~~

- <lime>cig_pods only</lime>
- Implements hooks:
  - hook_entity_type_alter()
    - Alters entity type definitions
    - Sets custom access handler for `asset` entity type
    - See [Custom Access Control](#custom-access-control)
  - hook_theme_registry_alter()
    - If theme is `gin`, changes path where template files are located for the `html` theme hook
    - Allows module to provide template files to override theme template files

#### ./cigpods.routing.yml

<lime>cig_pods:</lime>

- Defines routes to controllers and forms
- Fixed empty `_title` properties
- Added leading `/` to paths
- Fixed typos

<teal>cig_pods_csc:</teal>

- Defines single route for `/create/workbookdate`

TODO:

- Remove unnecessary duplication of routes (see examples of how other modules handle repeating forms for multiple bundles.) This will need to be followed up with consolidating form controllers.
- Make sure all controllers are in place and correctly namespaced.

#### ./cigpods.views.inc

- <lime>cig_pods only</lime>
- Implements hook_views_data() to register a new argument handler
- Used for contextual filtering?

TODO: Tech discovery on why this is here

### ./config/install/

- Configs for views, taxonomies, asset types, logs, etc.
- Combined all from both projects and changed module name

TODO: Tech discovery: make sure all of these are still being used. Can they be included in config management instead?

### ./css/, ./js/, ./img/

- See [Removal of Drupal's Theming System](#removal-of-drupals-theming-system)

### ./src/Controller/PopupController.php

- <lime>cig_pods only</lime>
- Methods for AJAX requests for opening modal confirmation dialogs

TODO:

- Hard-coded form classes need to be refactored
- Add exception handling (ex. on asset handling, if `$asset_id` is invalid or the asset doesn't exist.)
- Replace direct calls to `\Drupal` services (ex. `\Drupal::entityTypeManager()`) with dependency injection
- Look at [api.drupal.org](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Ajax%21OpenModalDialogCommand.php/class/OpenModalDialogCommand/10) for docs on `OpenModalDialogCommand`; specifically, why are we not using the `$title` `$options` and `$content` properties?

### ./src/Form/

- <lime>cig_pods only</lime>
- Multiple forms

TODO: Code review of form classes

### ./src/Plugin/Asset/AssetType/

- In both <lime>cig_pods</lime> and <pink>cig_pods_csc</pink>

#### <lime>cig_pods</lime> asset types

- Award.php
- Awardee.php
- Contact.php
- CostSequence.php
- FieldAssessment.php
- Input.php
- Irrigation.php
- LabResult.php

- SoilHealthSample.php

#### <pink>cig_pods_csc</pink> asset types

- FieldEnrollment.php
- ImportHistory.php
- ProducerEnrollment.php
- PartnerActivities.php
- ProjectSummary.php

#### Conflicting asset types

- Project.php

Separating into two asset types:

- SHProject.php
- CSCProject.php

TODO: Tech discovery on refactoring these into one entity type with a field for 'SH' or 'CSC'

### ./src/Plugin/Log/{LogType}.php

- <pink>cig_pods_csc only</pink>
- Log types
- TODO: code review

### ./src/Plugin/views/argument/

- <lime>cig_pods only</lime>
- See [Custom Access Control](#custom-access-control)

### ./src/ProjectAccessControlHandler.php

- <lime>cig_pods only</lime>
- See [Custom Access Control](#custom-access-control)
- Defines custom access control handler for entities
- Includes methods to integrate with the Views module to alter queries

### ./templates/html.html.twig

- See [Removal of Drupal's Theming System](#removal-of-drupals-theming-system)

## Issues

### Custom Access Control

`ProjectAccessControlHandler.php` defines custom access control handling. It extends `Drupal\entity\UncacheableEntityAccessControlHandler` and it appears to override access checks for creating and interacting with entities.

This approach is significantly outside of Drupal's already robust user and role management system.

#### Attaching roles to the session

We are defining two roles, `isAdmin()` and `isAwardee()` and attaching them to the session. This is bypassing Drupal's well-tested, secure and comprehensive user/permissions systems. Drupal assign roles to *user accounts*, not *sessions*. A session-based approach is outside of Drupal's long-established, supported, and tested functionality.

#### Security risks

Using Drupal's built-in user-based approach gives the assurance of Drupal's data security. Creating an alternate session-based approach does not. Our Drupal sites will be handling secure data. Using sessions means we are risking exposure, and we alone are responsible for making sure it remains secure.

#### Compatibility problems

Other modules (those in Drupal core as well as contributed modules) rely on Drupal's user-based role and permission systems. Replacing it with custom code requires us to create and maintain workarounds so that our code integrates with Drupal.

**TL;DR** Session-based role assignment makes our site more brittle, less secure, and less sustainable.

### Removal of Drupal's Theming System

The PODS-SH and PODS-CSC sites both follow the non-standard approach to theming that the FarmOS distribution uses. In Drupal, themes are the correct place to handle the presentation layer, which includes CSS, JavaScript, and Twig template files.

#### Separation of concerns

Themes maintain the fundamental principle of separation of concerns. While Drupal's modules do allow for some elements of themes to be included in certain circumstances (i.e. a module that adds charts, graphs, diagrams, etc. would include the CSS, JS, and Twig markup for the page elements that it has added), modules are not the intended place for a site's primary theme; they are to be used for functionality, not presentation.

#### Asset management

Themes add their CSS and JS to pages using the render array, which ensures that files are loaded in the right order for performance and caching. Libraries in themes manage and aggregate these assets to ensure that they are loaded not only in the correct order, but only when needed.

Bypassing this system by brute-force adding assets to pages will cause performance issues and can create styling issues that are very difficult to triage.

#### Caching

Drupal's caching system is built around the standard theming workflow. Bypassing the theming layer can create suboptimal caching which affects site performance.
